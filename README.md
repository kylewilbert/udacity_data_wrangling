## Overview of Project
For this Udacity project, we were asked to wrangle data about the Twitter account WeRateDogs
(@dog_rates).

- The first dataset was an archive of tweets from WeRateDogs, presented to us as a CSV.
- The second was a TSV of image predictions results that we downloaded programmatically. The
project creator passed the photos from the tweets into a machine learning project and it spit
out these predictions.
- And the third source we scraped from Twitter using the Tweepy Python library.
- After wrangling and cleaning the data, I was left with 1992 tweets (no retweets).
